[Hat.sh](https://hat.sh) is a web app that provides secure file encryption in the browser. It's **fast**, **secure** and runs **locally**, the app never uploads the files to the server. It uses modern secure cryptographic algorithms with chunked AEAD stream encryption/decryption.

V2 of hat.sh introduced memory efficient in-browser large file chunked encryption using streams with libsodium.js

## Usage

![how-to-use-gif](https://i.imgur.com/UItKNzB.gif)

<br>

## Features

### Security

- XChaCha20-Poly1305 - for symmetric encryption.
- Argon2id - for password-based key derivation.
- X25519 - for key exchange.

The libsodium library is used for all cryptographic algorithms.

### Privacy

- The app runs locally in your browser.
- No data is ever collected or sent to anyone.â€‹

### Functionality

- Secure encryption/decryption of files with passwords or keys.
- Secure random password generation.
- Asymmetric key pair generation.
- Authenticated key exchange.
- Password strength estimation.

<br>

## Offline Use

The app can be easily self hosted, please follow the [installation](https://hat.sh/about/#installation) instructions.

<br>

## What's new in v2

- switching to xchacha20poly1305 for symmetric stream encryption and Argon2id for password-based key derivation. instead of AES-256-GCM and PBKDF2.
- using the libsodium library for all cryptography instead of the WebCryptoApi.
- in this version, the app doesn't read the whole file in memory. instead, it's sliced into 64MB chunks that are processed one by one.
- since we are not using any server-side processing, the app registers a fake download URL (/file) that is going to be handled by the service-worker fetch api.
- if all validations are passed, a new stream is initialized. then, file chunks are transferred from the main app to the
  service-worker file via messages.
- each chunk is encrypted/decrypted on it's on and added to the stream.
- after each chunk is written on disk it is going to be immediately garbage collected by the browser, this leads to never having more than a few chunks in the memory at the same time.

<br>

## Browser Compatibility

We officially support the last two versions of every major browser. Specifically, we test on the following

- **Chrome** on Windows, macOS, and Linux , Android
- **Firefox** on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Safari** on iOS and macOS
- **Edge** on Windows

Safari and Mobile browsers are limited to 1GB files, due to lack of support with server-worker fetch api.
